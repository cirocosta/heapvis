DESIRE

	- spot memory leaks that might be going on

	

HOW TO GET THERE

	- observe memory as it goes, aiding that with profiling data

		- take heap dumps from time to time
		  
		  (for i in $(seq 1 100); do curl pprof ; sleep 1m ; done)

		- analyze the profiles taken

			-- create list of profiles
			-- compare the allocations across them all


FORMAT

	we could leverage pprof's exposition format for profiling data
		-> what's the format for heapdumps?
